# celeb lookalike finder

this is a cool project i made that tells u which famous person u look like. it uses a webcam or u can just upload a pic and it finds ur twin lol.

### how to run it
1. install the stuff: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. run the app: `python app.py`
3. go to `localhost:5000` in ur browser

### how it works
it uses some ai face recognition thing to compare ur face to like a bunch of celebrities. if it doesn't see any famous people it will download some new ones in the background.

i mostly made this for fun so yeah.

### stuff u need
u need a TMDB api key if u want it to show the pictures properly but u have to put that in the environment variables.
